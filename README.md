## LEIHL TLDR
### TLDR of changes:
# 1. Change the calculations so that it does not use numpy functions that directly compute distances
# 2. Include hyper parameter tuning for k values (although not fully implemented yet) 
# 3. Added visualisations for the training data (scatter plot of first two features)
# 4. Implement random forest classifier (extension of decision trees)
